## 📝 Notes

This repository serves as an archive of my Piscine journey — a personal challenge I took on to learn a new programming language (C) and sharpen my coding logic and problem-solving skills. These foundational projects helped me think differently, debug more effectively, and deepen my understanding of low-level programming; all of which complement my background in data science and AI.
